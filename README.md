PianoAI is a simple, beginner-friendly piano sheet music editor with generative AI tooling.
This project was initially meant to be a playground for a generative note model I created, however eventually became an opportunity to develop stronger full-stack skills and create an editor that doesn't include the often cluttered UI other editors have.
The app was built with NextJS and Tailwind, with the model being a Pytorch model (https://github.com/AmarDhillon05/PianoAI-model-API) that I plan to improve, and a DynamoDB database.
Currently, the app is a bare-bones implementation of my original idea, and I plan on making imporvements such as adding more functionality to the editor and sharing, and finding ways to refine the model while still building it myself.
