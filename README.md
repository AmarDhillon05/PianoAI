PianoAI is a simple, beginner-friendly piano sheet music editor with generative AI tooling.
This project was initially meant to be a playground for a generative note model I created, however eventually became an opportunity to develop stronger full-stack skills and create an editor that doesn't include the often cluttered UI other editors have.
The app was built with NextJS and Tailwind, with the model being a Pytorch model (https://github.com/AmarDhillon05/PianoAI-model-API) that I plan to improve, and a DynamoDB database.
Currently, the app is a bare-bones implementation of my original idea, and I plan on making imporvements such as adding more functionality to the editor and sharing, and either trying to replicate other note generation structures like Google's Magenta, finding datasets more cultured to this task, and/or fine tuning an LLM for the task
