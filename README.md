PianoAI is a simple, beginner-friendly web app for creating and sharing piano sheet music with AI assistance. 
This began as a way to implement a music generation model I was developing, however eventually became an idea for an uncluttered music editor, as well as an opportunity to grow my fullstack skills and design complex systems. 
The app was implemented with Nextjs & Tailwind, with DynamoDB for storage, and the model used to generate music currently being off of Huggingface since the model I was developing was slow and unpolished.
Future plans for this app including refining and using my own model for generation, expanding the scope and performance of the editor, and adding more features like sharing links and scores that can be edited by multiple users.
