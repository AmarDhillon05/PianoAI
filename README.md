PianoAI is a simple, beginner-friendly piano sheet music editor with generative AI tooling.
This project was initially meant to be a playground for a generative note model I created, however eventually became an opportunity to develop stronger full-stack skills and create an editor that doesn't include the often cluttered UI other editors have.
The app was built with NextJS and Tailwind, with the model being one from HuggingFace since the model I built was slow and unpolished, and a DynamoDB database.
Currently, the app is a bare-bones implementation of my original idea, and I plan on making imporvements such as adding more functionality to the editor and sharing, and refining and implementing a model for more efficiency in generation.
